# Cybersecurity Test App
This website was made as a test for the potential core members of the cybersecurity club of IIT Bhilai. This test includes studying endpoints, requests and having knowledge of basic SQL injection.
### Tech Stack:
-  ExpressJS
- EJS
### Frontend:
Made using EJS templating engine for JavaScript. The EJS templates with variables and their values are rendered by the backend server.
### Backend:
Multiple endpoints serve different EJS templates. The SQL database used is SQLite. The parametric expressions are not used for SQL queries as it treats all input as data, checking SQL injection. Instead, template strings are used.
